Hi There!~üëã

As a frontend developer with 2+ years of experience, I have found my calling in the world of information technology since high school. I also learn some backend dev things to improve my skills. I learn backend to become fullstack developer some day. My fascination with computers and technology led me to dive headfirst into the IT world with great enthusiasm, and I fell in ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è with web development since I graduate from high school. Throughout my career journey, I have always been highly motivated to learn quickly and accurately. I embrace new challenges and eagerly embrace emerging technologies as an enterprise person, emphasizing the importance of grasping the basics of every evolving technology I encounter to build robust and reliable solutions.
